# Salifort Motors: Predict and Improve Employee Retention
a capstone project for Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program

## Executive Summary

## Overview

### About the company

Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort’s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.        

### Business case

Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. (Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go). Salifort’s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Further, the high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. 

If Salifort could predict whether an employee will leave the company, and discover the reasons behind their departure, they could better understand the problem and develop a solution. 

As a first step, the leadership team asks Human Resources to survey a sample of employees to learn more about what might be driving turnover. As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, I have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has asked to analyze the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, I am asked to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points that may be helpful. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees.
